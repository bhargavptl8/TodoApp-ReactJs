# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


TodoApp is a task management application built with React.js. It features a MUI-styled UI, icons from React Icons, and form handling with Formik. Routing is managed by React-Router-Dom v6, with state managed by Redux and Redux Persist. Users can sign up, log in, and reset passwords to access a personalized todo list page, React-Toastify.
